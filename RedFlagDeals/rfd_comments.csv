0,"Hottest Dell deal I've seen in a while. Thanks to @Neovingian for bringing this to my attention. Sign up with an email address and get a 15% off coupon that stacks with other discounts like 10%OFFMONITOR. Also Rakuten has special 6% cash back right now which makes the deals fantastic when combined with Cyber Event discounts, doorcrashers etc. One thing is it works only with work side stuff, I tried applying the discount to Alienware monitors and it doesn't work (only 10%OFFMONITOR does). I'm guessing these are some of the best prices since lockdown hit. I just ordered a Dell U3415W for $620 - 6%CB = $582. Fantastic price, plus it comes with a 3 year advance exchange warranty and premium panel guarantee. I already own one of these monitors and they are my favourite thing. I couldn't justify the extra cost for the USB-C version, though my wife had to nix me buying the U3818W for ~$950. For the 15% coupon I did have to wait overnight but it came in less than 24 hours. So, not sure how long Rakuten is doing its cash back but should at least stay at 2%. This should work for laptops etc too, but since I was shopping here are a couple deals. And, to top it all off, if you happen to have access to a Business Platinum Amex, you are going to lose your mind because they have a promotion where you get a $250 statement credit for spending $250 at Dell (that's right, 100% back haha). I'm assuming that works with all this but I don't have one as it is a high cost card. dell.ca/amex Pic below of a few of the deals - bear in mind this is before cash back. The 15% off coupon works on multiple items in a single order. The 10%OFFMONITOR works only once per order. "
1,Something to note is that it seems like the coupon code only works for Dell branded products.
2,Isn't Rakuten 2% today? I can't see the 6%.
3,OP you should block out your coupon code if you don't want people stealing it

5,"yesnomaybe wrote:  OP you should block out your coupon code if you don't want people stealing it I used it... but yeah maybe. Thanks, I did it."

7,"Blubbs wrote:  I used it... but yeah maybe. Thanks, I did it. after you sighed up, did you get a confirmation email immediately? or only the email with coupon arrived after some time?"
8,Does it work on Alienware ultrawide?
9,"MrBigNose wrote:  after you sighed up, did you get a confirmation email immediately? or only the email with coupon arrived after some time? The post says they had to wait overnight."
10,"Last round of Dell coupons like this, Dell didn't ship most of the orders - wouldn't get excited until you see a shipping confirmation."
11,amex $250 credit term says must purchase on dell/amex site. in this case when we use rakuten cashback the amex credit will still be applied? Thanks.
12,"I signed up for a 15% coupon on the weekend, still haven't received one."
13,"holy this is a good deal. i just bought the u2719dc for ~$100 more. just 2 weeks ago. i guess im within the return period, but i also used dell rewards to purchase so i don't even know how that works. also returning a monitor seems like it'd be a huge pain."
14,I signed up last week as well.. didn't get the coupon
15,Signed up. Waiting for my coupon

17,"Thanks OP, It's always nice to get a shout out and be appreciated   I assumed the dell coupon stacking was common knowledge, the best double stacks, are when you can stack 2 X 15% +cb or super rare 20 %+15% + CB, even better when it works with Alienware products (hello mechanical keyboard & mouse combo, lol!).  Dell likes to pull the ole okie doke and change the prices of its products weekly and sometimes the next day, if it changes before your ship date you can usually still get it adjusted. Keep checking the price of your monitor and see if you can get any further savings by calling Dell, worst case you may have to cancel and do a new order but may lose out on promos by doing so. In my case, I did another order and the price of my items dropped by $75 a few days later. I was able to replicate the order but lost 5% due to a different code, but it was worth it. Enjoy!"
18,still waiting for coupon as well. Thanks Dell 
19,"For people who haven't gotten an email, you may have signed up in the past or something else may have gone wrong, I'd try a few emails. Cheers"
20,"MrBigNose wrote:  after you sighed up, did you get a confirmation email immediately? or only the email with coupon arrived after some time? Only the email when it arrived. It's just radio silence which is a bit annoying."

Thanks again. Most coupons on the Dell Home side don't stack anymore which is I think why this is hot. I guess it must be a more common thing on the work side."

Cheers Thanks for this post.. but I find these coupon hit and miss.. I have used an account that never signed up for any dell emails and still didn't get it. Alienware used to have the 10% off coupon as well but not anymore"
23,"Has anybody confirmed this works for laptops? This seems to be the assumption, but it looks like people have only bought monitors with this so far."
24,"MentalAnarchy wrote:  Has anybody confirmed this works for laptops? This seems to be the assumption, but it looks like people have only bought monitors with this so far. Works with this Doorbuster laptop, just tested. I think it will work anything that is not Alienware. And it works with multiple items in one order as stated. "
25,"Tried a new work email, and no email for 15% off. I'll give it a day here and see whats the hold up."
26,"MentalAnarchy wrote:  Has anybody confirmed this works for laptops? This seems to be the assumption, but it looks like people have only bought monitors with this so far. Works with laptops if they are under work category. Sadly no ryzen 4000 laptops available... Btw code is good until August 15, maybe something decent will go on sale."
27,Can this deal somehow stack a 10% Unidays on top? That would sweet.

35,up vote for quality post with instructions and examples
36,U3818DW - I paid 1250 before taxes lol dang . It is been less than a week.  But if anyone is holding back on getting 38 inch - this is a very very good price!

I wanted it so bad... But I don't need the extra vertical space to be honest. I already have one U3415W and this will be my second for the standing desk behind me, plus spousal use. At $582 vs $970 I just couldn't justify the 38"" lol. Even knowing it was the best price!"
38,"A lot of their IPS monitors are stated to be 5ms grey-to-grey and 8ms something else, what does this mean in terms of comparison to a 10 year old IPS monitor simply stated to be 5ms response time?"

40,"Originalmotto wrote:  These monitors need to stack with another 50% off for me to consider them  The coupon applies to any business monitor, there are plenty of cheaper ones on sale too. These are just examples. Check out the website!"
41,"does it work for dell desktops, like alienware r9?"
42,"My coupon took like 10 days to arrive. That was like few weeks ago. But i did sign up using another email few days later and both coupons came in around the same time. So i dont know if they only release these coupons every so often. I did chat with Dell agent, and was told that coupon normally takes 7 days to arrive."
43,Working for anyone else?

51,10%OFFMONITOR not working anymore for me. Home or Work site. I think it's a glitch as the coupon shows on their Coupons page:  
52,"When I try to use the 10%OFFMONITOR coupon I get ""This is a valid coupon code, but there are no matching items currently in your cart."" I'm only trying to buy an Ultrasharp monitor, it work for anyone? I tried on both the business and consumer website.  edit: Student 10% code still works, but I haven't received any email signup code."
53,"Same thing, same error message. Tried with a U4919DW monitor."

70,"15% Code showed up. The 10%OFFMONITOR code worked again after following the link from the email. I compared pricing to the same ultrasharp monitor that was bought pre-covid, and with both the 10% and 15% stacked coupons its still within +- 5% of the price I paid at the beginning of the year, so only a hot deal if you need a monitor now and can't wait. Student code doesn't stack with 10%OFFMONITOR FYI. edit: looked up my receipt for comparison with pre-covid with 10% off the price was $904+tax, now the price is $840+tax for the same 43"" 4k monitor, so a better deal than I thought.

Yea, and when they do that, I just pull out my american visa infinite card - which costs them far more. International fee + Visa infinite fee is way more than a local amex in nearly every case. I think the majority of small businesses are ignorant and just don't look at their numbers, and just go on the out-of-date common hearsay that amex used to have the highest fee's by far. For small mom and pop shops, amex ""shop small"" whole purpose is to offer them the lowest fee's to boost their acceptance rates. I got a small local business to start accepting it and yea they told me it's their lowest fee card by far after that. Or they just look at 1 transaction of your average crappy secured visa/mc most ppl have vs any amex (since all amex cards infer the same merchant fee, where as Visa and mastercard are in tiers, with higher end cards inferring a higher merchant fee). Aside from the international thing, where they will all charge the merchant extra. Plus visa and mastercard charge higher activation fee's and monthly fee's then amex, which people don't factor into the overall cost to their business. Cuz amex does the same for businesses as personal users - huge sign up bonuses. They give extremely low rates the first year or more, and then competitive ones after that for small businesses, and other deals like no activation fee's, etc. It's really just medium sized businesses and travel type stuff amex sets high rates (because they can). And yea most are also just lazy, so let a bank or other third party set it all up (which costs them even more) and thus don't get the small business amex benefits. (Because the third party is getting the benefits). And since the majority of our third party payment processors and banks are not greatly partnered with amex, acceptance/fee aren't great. EG: Out of the big banks, only Scotia issues an amex, and while they do it, they aren't very big in the payment processing market - eg they dont make their own pinpads like TD Does. And while a TD pinpad can process amex, the default TD merchants plan obviously doesn't include that, and the higher end one that does, is not a good deal and does not give the merchants great amex rates. Where as the default recommended scotia merchants plan does include amex acceptance, also not at the best rates - thus why some merchants try to claim they don't accept it (but do because they just have that default scotia plan they were too lazy to change/negotiate). It's actually against amex merchants terms of service if they do that too. If they accept amex, they have to let you pay with it. They'll get in trouble for the incident if you report it:  "

I think many of us here signed up before May and were eligible for a welcome bonus which could net to almost $900 after the annual fee. Plus some of us received other bonus perks like the $250 credits for groceries. I’m just hoping that at least some new cardholders will keep the card after their first year. With so many people took advantage of this once in a lifetime double redemption event which were meant to substitute the useless travel perks for now, Amex will be losing so much money for this promotion. And potentially lead to a decrease in perks or increase in annual fees in the future."

191,Just so I'm sure: A qualifying purchase of at least $10 (CAD) in a single transaction that is made directly at a different participating business or different location of the same participating business will qualify for one $5 (CAD) statement credit up to a total maximum of $50 (CAD) in statement credits per registered Card during the offer period. One or more purchases made directly at the same business location will only be eligible to qualify for one $5 (CAD) statement credit. This means that if I were to go into the same shop on two different occasions and buy $10 worth of product each visit -- that I will only be eligible for one (rather than two) $5 statement credits? ...So find 10x different shops to shop at?

Merchants who do that sign up for a package deal merchant account, in which they agree to take Amex in exchange for lower Visa/MC fees. This obligates them to take Amex when a customer wants to pay with it. But then they write ""No Amex"" with a sharpie and tape it to the POS terminal. These merchants are running a scam on their payment provider. This really isn't any of my business until they tell me they don't take my Amex. Then they've just pulled me into their scam. I don't hesitate to call out these merchants and pay with Amex anyway, because I'm not interested in being an accomplice in their scam."

Amex has a huge marketing/new accounts department and they will call the local business to either make them a offer to accept amex, or see why they aren't accepting it even though they should/can. I only reported a few, but one started accepting amex not long after, which didn't accept. And another, which probably did, but denied me, took the piece of paper off that was lazy-ly covering the amex logo on their door and happily accepted it next time I went."

My guess is the one with two icons are some of the ones who participated last year or multiple previous events, and they forgot to remove/disable it for this year so it got duplicated. naticom wrote:  In the old spend $5 Get $5 events, many store also had the Shop Small badge but only those ones also had Spend $5 Get $5 badge actually participated in the event I remember that. But you could tell by activating the filter, In my area (KW), there was only like 2 restaurants participating. This year the filter does still work - it does remove results, but in my area mostly just big business like sobeys etc. Not all, but almost all small businesses that take amex seem eligible. The previous restaurant from last year is there, but so are a ton of others. It doesn't show the duplicate icons like you see though. None of those in KW. I think this year they are just greatly expanding the event to any ""shop small"" merchant, due to the pandemic and the fact it's up'd to $10 spend minimum."

When I first gave them a call the owner told me they don't take AMEX, but after the meal I pulled out my AMEX they said nothing and let me complete the transaction.

They just don't wanna take AMEX. No, these aren't cases of merchants just not signing up to accept amex because they don't want to.  Majority of them agreed to accept all three card networks when applying for payment processing which usually results in them paying less fees, but when they decide on their own to not accept Amex while legally agreeing to the payment processor that they will accept Amex is that's a totally different ball game vs them not signing up to accept Amex in the first place.  Majority of the merchants on the general amex merchants list/map have all signed up with their payment processors (i.e. TD, Moneris, etc.) to accept Amex that's why they show up."

They just don't wanna take AMEX. But I did ran into one exception - it was a very good French restaurant (but not owned by a French) in Port Moody, BC. When I first gave them a call the owner told me they don't take AMEX, but after the meal I pulled out my AMEX they said nothing and let me complete the transaction. That was during the old shop small ""spend $5 get $5"". I went there because the restaurant was on the map, but they're now long gone (from the map). I know this isn’t AMEX related but what’s the place called? If it’s good, I want to visit!"

Well actually it's pretty simple.  If a business doesn't want to accept Amex then they need to specify that to their payment processor (PP) when signing up, because when you tell the PP that you are willing to accept all three credit card networks you end up with overall lower fees that need to be paid. So by telling the PP you will accept Amex but then turning around and telling customers ""we can't accept Amex"" when you know fully well you can that's an issue of defrauding the PP and Amex."

Here's a little trick... if a merchant has a ""No Amex"" sign taped onto their terminal, there's a 99.9% chance they actually *DO* take Amex! Every time you see that sign, use your Amex, and collect your points! Lots of these merchants will try to watch what card you're using and tell you they don't take Amex if they see one, or they won't even hand you the terminal as they want to take your card to insert it themselves so they can tell you No Amex if you hand them one. If they accept tap just tap your phone upside down where they can't see the screen, or conceal the card as you put it in so they don't see it's an Amex. It'll be accepted. ""The Kitchen Table"" food stores in Toronto used to be notorious for this. The have an Amex sticker on their door, a little placard next to the the cash register displaying the Visa, MC, Amex and Interac logos on it, yet they claim to not take Amex lol. One time they told me No Amex, I concealed my card when putting in the terminal, and after my Amex was approved the cashier saw the receipt said ""american express"" as it was printing and then she freaked out and said they can't take Amex and I need to refund the transaction and use a different card. I just laughed and walked out. I think a lot of managers in these situations are using scare tactics on their cashiers to get them to not take Amex cards. Typically businesses that truly don't accept Amex don't bother putting ""No Amex"" signs anywhere. The terminal will just decline it or give an error, and then they'll (honestly) tell you that they don't accept it. Like other posters have mentioned, these businesses knowingly and willingly agreed to accept Amex in order to get lower rates on Visa/MC transactions, and they are contractually bound to accept Amex cards. As a business owner I have ZERO sympathy for businesses refusing Amex because it's ""too expensive"" when they agreed to accept it to save on other merchant fees. Nobody forced them to accept it. Saying they don't accept it in an attempt to make a higher profit is plain and simple fraud."

That also explains the mysterious $5 credit that showed up the day after I visited my Dentist who also takes Amex. Definitely pays to register your card(s) as who knows where you might stumble onto a $5 credit.

Other people are free to do what they want  Yesterday, I had a $20 takeout order for a restaurant that's new to me and I added a $10 tip. 50% is much more than an usual tip, of course, but the way I think of it, $5 of the tip is coming from AMEX directly. Also, I'm sure restaurants would gladly take a walk-in/take-out order that pays with AMEX vs. a delivery order where they're paying much higher fees to UberEats/SkipTheDishes/etc. While profit is great, of course, a business also needs revenue (even with lower profit) to help cover fixed expenses. This promo is good if it drives new business to a restaurant. If an usual customer was going to purchase something anyway, and just now uses AMEX instead of debit, then, yeah, it's not helpful for the business."

This is an OUTDATED understanding of AMEX's fees. Since AMEX decided to take a more aggressive approach in winning acceptance rate with small businesses, their rates are now very competitive with VISA/MasterCards. I think all the stores saying no have not actually not reviewed AMEX's current fee structure and rather than relying on their experience from 10+ years ago or on hearsay."

Some terminals don't work with tap for Amex and you have to insert the card. Seems like the tap not working alerted retailer to fact it was Amex - which they probably agreed to take as part of the merchant agreement but decided to not accept to reduce fees.  This promo is generous especially when you compare it to other Canadian Banks, what promos are they offering right now for existing cardholders?

Seems like the tap not working alerted retailer to fact it was Amex - which they probably agreed to take as part of the merchant agreement but decided to not accept to reduce fees. There needs to be a separate merchant services agreement signed between the merchant and Amex. Visa and MC can be signed on the same agreement. It's Amex that has required a separate merchant services agreement in the past. If the merchant has not signed one with Amex, the customer will not be able to use tap with the terminal with an Amex card. Oddly enough, their terminal may end up showing an approval if the Amex card is swiped on the terminal instead. However, without an actual agreement with the merchant and Amex, Amex and the merchant services provider are under NO OBLIGATION to deposit the funds to the merchants account. This actually happened to a friend of mine, who ended up successfully suing a customer in small claims who thought they were being smart by swiping. The customers card was charged, yet the funds were never MSP deposited. The customer claimed that since the charge was on his Amex, he was in the clear. My friend ended up providing monthly statements from Global showing that the funds were in fact not deposited to his merchant account, as well as his original merchant services agreement which specifically stated that a separate agreement needed to be signed to accept Amex, as well as a letter from Global stating that he in fact did not have a signed agreement with Amex. Point of this ramble: Merchants have the legal right to dictate how payments can be made."

I don't disagree with merchants having the right to dictate how payments are made, but I do think it's disingenuous to sign up for a payment agreement, appear as accepting the card on a merchant map due to your agreement with said provider, and then decline to accept it as a method of payment.  They've agreed to this being a method of payment through their merchant agreement with AMEX and AMEX are communicating to their customer bases that this is an acceptable payment method as per this agreement. It's not on the customer to enforce this however. If I was at a merchant anyway and they were on a merchant map as accepting Amex but said no Amex, I wouldn't put up a fight and I'd pay with Visa / Mastercard / Debit however it would make me think twice before returning.  Your friends issue seems seperate to the examples most refer to in this thread, which are merchants on the Amex map refusing Amex so it's not something I'm going to debate. Seems like a customer taking advantage of what they thought was a ""loophole""."

809,While I've been with virgin too for the last year I'm looking to jump ship as well. I'd say the virgin customer service has been pretty decent. I'm currently using 50 mbs package but find the wifi or connection craps out every now and then. Can anyone comment on these guys? Their 150 bundle is only 8 dollars less than teksavvy. To get 150 I'm gonna have to switch to cable service which bugs me a bit because I feel they're gonna need to hang a wire across the Street or trees.

824,"I agree with the comment about their customer service department. It works well when it works. And I wanted to like it because of the price, but cancelled because of the spotty connection (downtown Toronto). Cancelled after a year. Not sure about CS for new activation, but CS is hard to get a hold of when you are trying to cancel—Agents trying to keep you from leaving call you multiple times and don’t process your cancellation, also doesn’t send you confirmation emails about the termination... So you are never sure if they processed it lol. You call to confirm, they transfer you to retention. Never again for me. Good price, and okay when it works.

909,"I just noticed this for the first time on sale at Costco. Might be cheaper in store, if anyone has seen them? Excellent set if you want something nonstick, with copper and aluminium, and it comes with a full 12"" skillet, not a 10"" one that is normal at this price point. 12"" is much larger and avoids crowding of food so food gets fried, not steamed. This is why this an exciting set of pans. That's the sandwiching: very thin layer of copper, but in terms of thermal mass it counts for a lot more than the thicker aluminium layers that surround it. All Clad's famous 3-ply skillet has an aluminium layer of 1.7mm of thickness by comparison. This is 8mm!! 4 mm of aluminum + 0.6 mm of copper is comparable to over 5 mm of aluminum in terms of heat-spreading ability, and then you have a protective 0.5 mm thick layer of magnetic stainless on the bottom to make it more durable and induction-compatible. That’s an impressive amount of heat-spreading ability already–comparable to the thick disc bottoms you see on many premium stock pots. But then consider that the hard-anodized aluminum cooking vessel on top of that is 2.54 mm thick (as measured by my pair of micrometers). Assuming Anolon isn’t lying about the thickness of its base, we’re talking the equivalent of ~8 mm of aluminum on the bottom. That’s an epic amount of heat-spreading power–in theory it should rival 2.5 mm copper pans. These pans come with lifetime warranties, and b) these pans use DuPont’s top-of-the-line Teflon, which should be more durable than normal–so durable that the manufacturer claims you can use metal spatulas on it. If it weren’t for the PTFE issue, these pans would score a perfect 5/5 on value because they are absolutely the best nonstick pans I have ever tried. You can even scramble eggs in them without a drop of oil, if you’re calorie-counting. They are extremely even-heating (see above), incredibly comfortable to hold, induction compatible, and even easier to clean up than normal nonstick pans, due to the nonstick-coated, flush rivets. You can read the entire review here:  "

I didn't get the Greenpan set because the medium pot was too big and the small pot was too small. I think it's because it had that space saving stack design or something. The sizes in this set seem more usable. I'll wait see if this set goes on sale / clearance."

I see what you mean. I had that thought myself. It's a strong material so a thin pot should be durable and resist warping. I wouldn't use it for anything but boiling water. ""Stainless steel holds the honor of having the worst overall thermal characteristics of all the metals used for cookware. It has the highest specific heat per cubic centimeter and the lowest thermal conductivity -- not a good combination."" It might be fine for your purposes. Yeah, I remember now. The Atlantis has a copper layer, but still very expensive. I remember there was a Belgian or German store that had deals on it, but still a 12"" pan would have been nearly the cost of this entire set with shipping. Zwilling USA had a clearance sometime back on these or the 5 ply version of the Demeyere pans.  "
927,"Thx OP, in the market for a quality cookware during Covid, appreciate the ""Masterclass"" education!"
928,"I consider all non-stick as disposable, but this is a really great price. I would still add a stainless steel or cast iron pan/pot to your arsenal for when you want fond. Edit: the more I look at this, the more epic I realize the deal is. That thermal ranking is off the charts good. It's better than Cuisinart MCP and you get a full set for the cost of one multi-clad pan. Chapeau OP!"

I like stainless for their durability, but didn't have any success using them as fry pan. I know nonstick pan will never last forever, but so much easier to use and clean. I hope this Anolon set will last, at least I got Costco and manufacture double lifetime warranty. This Anolon set are also more useful I think, the 12 inch fry pan is better than 10 inch and too many sauce pan in the Cuisinart set."

Used a Staub and it was just as good but the black interior killed it for me and why want that one flaw for about $50-100 less? You have raised some excellent points and I'd like to provide some perspective as to why these are interesting pans. A bit of background, I've been cooking since I was 7, worked every summer in the family Chinese restaurant from ages 14 - 18 and then did prep and saute stations to pay my way through university. I am by no means a classically trained chef (though I did a brief stint at Le Cordon Bleu), but I'm pretty decent in the kitchen (I never want to devein a shrimp ever again). 1. I fully agree that non-stick is disposable, but some non-stick is more disposable than others. If Teflon is to be believed, the PTFE coating on this pan has a melting point of somewhere around 600 - 700 F (though it probably starts degrading around 450 - 500 F) and has 400% the abrasion resistance of their next best coating. For context, that's about how hot an empty cast iron or stainless steel pan gets when you are searing. Most (sane) people are never going to heat a non-stick pan like that because they will already have fat in the pan and even the most stable oil, safflower, will smoke at 500 F. The Maillard reaction kicks in at around 320 F, which is about the smoking point for most commonly used fats (butter, olive oil and animal lards) and probably the ideal temperature for a saute. Simply put, this will safely be within the thermal range that most people cook and the coating should last. Also, most professional chefs beat the shit out of their pans.  2. The thermal properties of these pans are excellent, especially for the price. Heat distribution is nearly perfectly uniform with no hot spots. Their heat distribution is more even than some of the most expensive multi-clad pans. On top of that, they heat extremely quickly due to the use of copper and aluminum. I haven't done a side-by-side infrared thermometer test, but it is substantially faster than my All-Clad D5 pots and pans. 3. The non-stick coating is ridiculously good. It's better than my seasoned Lodge cast iron skillet and my Chinese carbon steel wok by a huge margin. I have never had a non-stick pan where I could literally make caramel, fry eggs or melt cheeses without any fat and have them slide right off. I imagine for the inexperienced or the time pressured, this is a huge selling point. It's also a great selling point for those looking to cut down on their caloric intake. 4. Anolon has added a number of thoughtful design touches. The pans are riveted, but they did it in such a way that the interior of the pan is flush. You don't need spend extra time cleaning under the rivets. On top of that, the non-stick coating is so slick that clean-up for me is pour warm water on them and wipe with a soft sponge. The handles are nicely curved with thick enough material that they do not get hot to the touch and feel good in the hand. My All-Clad handles are well...there's a reason why the comfort of All-Clad is famously contentious. The lids are convex, so you get more breathing room before spill over when boiling, allows more air circulation when braising or simmering and keeps the handle cooler to the touch. They are also, in my wife's opinion, really aesthetically pleasing. I hope this helps shed some light on why these are interesting. No, they will not last you a lifetime like a good set of multi-clad, cast iron or carbon steel will. However, for most people, this should last at least a decade while giving them majority of the performance and features of multi-clad that will cost over 5x as much, while also having the benefits of the crazy good non-stick coating. PS> I agree, Le Creuset is way better than Staub. I have three cast iron pieces of cookware--Lodge skillet, Le Creuset enameled dutch oven and a Staub griddle pan (thanks work giveaway!)--and the Le Creuset is by far the best."

Mine works perfectly fine when it was compared to a $500 one. Off YMMV with the price. That's a great price.

1016,"I do use my Dutch oven on a weekly basis after warming it up in the oven for 30 minutes empty at 450 to bake bread. The seal and heat allows to hold the humidity from the dough and form a nice crust. For that purpose alone, I think a cast iron Dutch oven is unbeatable. For everything else, to all their preference. I like a good non stick pan for omelette, grilled cheese and a few other things. Could probably use a non-stick pot for some sauces. For the rest, I like multi-ply SS for the long term durability."

1018,"Great price for that set. But the copper core is a gimmick. It starts out stainless and the copper is so thin that you won't get any of the magical heating properties you get with copper. It's just going to be like every other stainless or stainless/aluminum pot. You best deal in the kitchen is pure aluminum. They are super conductive and super cheap. Sure, not quite copper, but just a fraction of the price. Stainless is a pretty poor performer compared to aluminum, copper, or even carbon steel, but it looks nice and shiny so everyone loves it. But this is a great deal for a non-stick set and really, it's not the pot that makes the dish."

Stainless is a pretty poor performer compared to aluminum, copper, or even carbon steel, but it looks nice and shiny so everyone loves it. It's actually close to an all-aluminium pot, with a layer each of copper and stainless steel. The black anodized aluminium has all the advantages of aluminium. At a total of 8mm equivalent Al thickness, it's probably the thickest aluminium pan on the market."

I would encourage you to try to return the Calphalon set, especially if it is non-stick. The coating will start to wear off in a year, even if you only use silicone utensils. The set we had was the one that actually said it was OK to use metal utensils on, but we thought well let's baby it .. nope. The warranty requires you to mail the defective items back to Calphalon, and well when that's a whole set, it's very expensive. We took advantage of Bed Bath and Beyond's return policy (which is really vague and basically ""any time you want"") and replaced them with a non-stick set, which has performed mediocre at best. Calphalon is very overpriced for what you get."

If it has a coating, like Demeyere's Silvinox coating, that can prevent the discolouration you get when it goes in the dishwasher. If it doesn't and if the Aluminium is exposed at the lip of the pan, that can be bad, but I don't think it would lead to corrosion.

1055,You can still get the deal in my area. Today is the last day. I just clicked the link and it was on sale.  Maybe certain areas the deal ended?
1056,Not sure why this is moved to expired when it is clearly still going on. @Mars2012 @TomRFD  
1057,Saw this Friday at Stockyards-Toronto. HD website lists the Ryobi P737D high pressure inflator at $39.98. Tagged in store at $34.88. At least 8 boxes there.  
1058,It's on sale but it's not a hot deal. For instance last month it was 29.99 at home depot.

1062,I got this about a month ago for $34.88 which I thought was already regular price. Still gave a thumbs up for the usefulness of it.  The time and effort it has saved me from pumping my bike tires up to 80psi was worth it alone.  I saw the other thread that there are Ryobi days coming soon. Not sure what the price will be by then.

I've also read that the ""Free"" version of the Oxiclean isn't absolutely necessary as people have noted that the perfume smell does not stick around, but I prefer to keep using the ""Free"" one anyway.

1112,"I used to buy the larger buckets and think they're great. Most of the time you'll be satisfied with the wash. When you need a little more juice, toss in some dollar store oxyclean knockoff with it. I also recommend people have an original Tide on hand, just ""Tide"" orange bottle, no special breeze or anything like that. It's overall the best cleaning detergent and that's why it has a premium cost attached to it. Use it sparingly for especially smelly or dirty clothes."

1115,"I tried it and felt my clothes looked used a lot quicker than using Tide. Also you really need to pretreat your clothes first if there is small stain.

1134," Ben TOP 500 REVIEWER 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Reviewed in Canada on June 8, 2019 Verified Purchase Love the size, the flavor, etc. ""The faceless person that decided to ""serve"" thick steaks with the spice mix was actually a man named ""The Shadow."" Morris ""The Shadow"" Sherman, to be exact. He was a broilerman who worked at Schwartz's, a legendary Montreal restaurant devoted to the Canadian cousin of pastrami called smoked meat. The famously pungent spice blend was used to cure the beef brisket before it was smoked and steamed. One day, Sherman sprinkled some of that smoked-meat blend over the liver he was broiling for his lunch. Customers clamored for the same spices on their steaks, and the Canadian Steak Invasion was underway. Schwartz's way of seasoning steak soon caught fire across North America, where countless carnivores started sprinkling their steaks with pastrami spices. Without even knowing it. And though those spices were made popularized at Schwartz's, they didn't originate in Old Montreal—more like the Old World. Romania, to be specific. Romanian Jews like Schwartz's founder, Reuben Schwartz, brought their home country's spiced-meat tradition of ""pastramă"" with him when he immigrated to Canada and opened his deli. And just like other cultural treasures, those ""pastramă"" spices were adapted to their new country without most people being aware of their origins."" 7 people found this helpful Some history on the whole Montreal steak spice.

Thanks for the tips. Been there done that: I bought the same large jar of keg spices from costco back in 2015... now there is still 2/3 left. Now I only use it for pork/chicken. Not steaks unless frozen leftover For lower quality cut of beef with less fat, such as eye of round or Kalbi, I feel a mix of the keg rub, along with some Korean BBQ sauce and Texan bbq sauce, and some pear juice taste better personally - the Korean bbq sauce is pretty affordable from T&T.  For better cut, I would prefer stick to freshly ground salt and pepper"
1177,To each their own I have Sous Vided steaks w salt and pepper but put Montréal steak spice after. I tried both just salt and pepper and salt and pepper with Montréal steak spice after its cooked and prefer it that way. Am I wrong because top she's and restaurants serve it salt and pepper? Maybe to those who think cus a top chef does it thay way it's wrong! But to me and those who use Montréal steak spice or keg steak spice or hp sauce we r not wrong. Whatever floats your boat abd to each their own  Whoever says sat and pepper only is not only ignorant but stubborn. Because there is no best way. The best way is how each individual likes their steak. Yes people even use ketchup w their steak. I personally don't do that and think it's gross but hey if they like it that way power to them. Who the eff an I to say otherwise?

1183,"McCormick in the US is, I think, what we refer to as Clubhouse. Anyway, we had their Montreal Steak Spice (MSS) marinade while visiting family and everyone loved it. When I looked at the ingredients in the pre-portioned package it seems to be just regular MSS, so I just make it and measure out the spice. It's excellent with skirt steak if you can find that cut. Copied the link to the product and the instructions from the link below.  "
1184,"dazz wrote:  That's not true. Again, if you ever dined in top restaurants, you'd know they typically only use salt and pepper. Just like a quick search on youtube also proves that. As this is what I often order when I dine, I am speaking from experience. And I've never even heard any remotely restaurants putting a pound of butter on a steak nor did I ever have it myself anywhere in the World. It's rarely any butter was used as well and(again, from experience) it was in very low quality pubs in USA. That's my experience and not what I read somewhere on some blog. I've also been fortunate to attend live cookouts by some of the top chefs in the past, seeing them cooking with you and giving tips and explanation on why certain things work better. One of the ingredients of this is dehydrated garlic(at least in what I have) and fresh galric(if needed) is way better so again, this is why best restaurants and chefs don't use such rubs. At least this rub doesn't have any MSG, which is good, since many others do have it.  As for charcoal, yes this my fav way as well and this is how I also cook it at home. Wow, first claiming that butter isn't used to cook steaks AND then goes on to criticize the use of MSG, which is the best way to get the fifth flavour, umami. Sorry, I can't trust anything you say."

Here's the thing about terminating a receptacle by pushing wires into the back as opposed to using the screws (called quick-wire), most installers who use this method then ensure all four screws are fully tightened. This would actually push the screws in tighter to the receptacle than they would have been if a wire were under them. This would in turn mean this USB wall plate's contact tabs are making a connection with less pressure against the screw heads than they would if the receptacle was not ""quick-wired"". Good that you mention you are playing with 120VAC, but as I mentioned earlier, you can also be playing with 240VAC for split receptacles. Another point I should mention - many homes often have a receptacle that has it's upper or lower half switched, to be used with a plug in lamp. If this USB plate contact tabs do in fact make a connection with both screws on both sides of the receptacle, you'll have just rendered that switch useless by installing this."

Yes, thanks for mentioning split receptacles (used a lot on kitchen counters in the pre-GFCI era). Using this would be a code violation in that case and also a really bad idea for so many reasons.

My budget is around this price. Also, when I went into staples they tried to talk my out of the laptop in the OP for this one and another similar HP saying it would blow the Lenovo out of the water:  "
1409,Thanks to both of the above replies. Any reason to not go with that Acer Aspire? More space and memory? Sorry I've tried to to a bunch of research already but my head is spinning trying to figure out what to do. I mostly want something that will last - I use the laptop to work (microsoft office apps) and sometimes to stream and that's basically it.

Not sure how battery life compares on the two."

Thanks all, promise to stop bugging you! 8GB of RAM won't be enough in 10 years. However, it will suffice for another 5 years of light workloads. 512GB SSD will suffice for another 5 years, possibly even another 10 years. Again, assuming lighter workloads. The Costco laptop is better for longer term use, not because it's more powerful, it's significantly less powerful. It's better because it's powerful enough for years and years of reasonable workloads, and because if you're set on keeping it 5 to 10 years... the ExcellencePlus Costco warranty option for an extra $100 is good protection against failure. Costco frequently cuts cheques for the original purchase price if a laptop has failed and proves too challenging to repair. They'll often err on the side of cutting cheques when a repair was feasible. Costco is such a good vendor that even with a weaker laptop, it would a better option for you if you're looking for vendor support and a longer-term laptop. Review:  "

1436,"Among the Ryzen U-Series Laptops, here's my intuition. (A) Lenovo Ideapad 3 15.6"" (2020) [Ryzen 4500U w/ (1x) SODIMM] - $699 Best value for money in the Ryzen 4th generation U-Series laptop space, among big box and online retailers. Especially attractive if you don't need 2-in-1 and don't require high color accuracy. The laptop screen is adequate, and looks good even in showroom lights, but doesn't appear to be IPS. The (1x) SODIMM slot allows for up to a (1x) 32GB SODIMM, but because the onboard 4GB RAM is clocked at 2666Mhz, the SODIMM will always clock to 2666Mhz or it's base clock if it's lower. The inclusion of a numpad makes this a viable desktop replacement with a USB-C docking station, subject to the appropriate WiFi Card, RAM, and SSD upgrades. The base 8GB of RAM is livable for day-to-day work, but more serious workloads should explore a (1x) 16GB 2666Mhz SODIMM upgrade, bringing the total RAM to 20GB. Optional Upgrades - Intel AX200NGW WiFi 6 Card - $30 (Amazon.ca) - 1 TB NVMe SSD - $170 (Amazon.ca) - 16GB 2666Mhz SODIMM - $100 (Amazon.ca) (B)  HP ENVY x360 15.6"" (2020) [Ryzen 4700U w/ (2x) SODIMMs] - $1099 Best performance Ryzen 4th generation U-Series laptop under $1100. This system allows for dual channel SODIMM upgrades up to (2x) 32GB = 64GB 3200Mhz DDR4. This workstation would provide the greatest memory headroom for specialized workloads, but vanishingly few need more than 32GB. The CPU is faster on benchmarks than the 4500U (nothing earth shattering), the GPU is modestly faster. This laptop is the best option for those looking for a 2-in-1, a larger 15.6"" IPS screen, a numpad for data entry, and improved performance. It also comes with the much lauded Intel AX200NGW WiFi 6 card and a 1TB NVMe SSD, saving you two potential upgrades. Optional Upgrades - (2x) 8GB 3200Mhz SODIMMs [16GB Total] You could theoretically put in (2x) 16GB 3200Mhz SODIMMs, or even (2x) 32GB SODIMMs. Whatever your heart fancies. (C) Lenovo Flex 14"" (2020) [Ryzen 4500U w/ No SODIMM] - $793 (expired) Best value for money in the Ryzen 4th generation U-Series 2-in-1 laptop space.

Meanwhile, this is the only option among the three laptops that provides a 14"" screen (at the cost of losing your numpad), as well as IPS 2-in-1 touch.

Honestly, we are not in a rush to buy a computer so we are more-so looking for a really good value for the $. Our price range is between $600-$1000. Portability is not an issue, we're used to bulky laptops. Ideally we would like to stick to the lower end of the range and then fork out a little extra for upgrades to bring the total closer to $1,000, but we would be willing to spend more if the value is worth the price.  I will have to take a much closer look with better time at the MemoryExpress Asus TUF laptop that you have just suggested, but again we are in no rush so we wouldn't mind holding off for a ""bargain"" deal. Basically, our main concern is getting the most for our buck, even if it means waiting for the ""opportune time"".

1456,"davi6030 wrote:  So I finally got mine today! Ordered May 23. I now finally have the 3 laptops that I ordered to test, the Flex 5 14, Ideapad 5 15, and the Ryzen 5 HP Envy from Costco. I'll give a quick summary of all three. I bought the Ideapad and the Flex both for around $839 (I wasn't going to cancel and reorder the Flex to save $20-30, and when it went below 800 mine had already been shipped), and the HP for $899. First, the Ideapad 5. Overall it's a decent laptop. However, I ended up ordering the Canadian keyboard which I know is an RFD no-no. I also hated it, it is not an ANSI layout like the HP bilingual keyboard is, which I don't mind. The number pad is also smaller than the rest of the keys and I didn't find it very useful, and the num pad is full size on the HP. The screen is matte while still being a touchscreen, and brightness is good (300 nit compared to 250 on the other two). It has plastic bezels instead of the flush glass bezels of the other two. Unfortunately, not being a 2-in-1 with a pen was a strike against it. The one nice thing is that the charger is a single piece brick that plugs into the wall, as opposed to the standard AC adapters and wall cords. But, it's a barrel plug, not USB-C. Lastly, the speakers are terrible compared to the Flex, and especially the HP with the Bang and Olufsen branded audio. Build quality is decent with an aluminum lid, but the plastic on the bottom feels quite cheap. Next, the HP, the other 15"" competitor. The HP is thinner than the Ideapad but has a larger footprint due to the larger bottom bezel on the screen. It is also an aluminium body and is HEAVY. The difference in weight with the plastic ideapad is definitely noticeable. Also, the magnet that holds the lid closed is very strong, and the lip is not easy to lift with one hand. However, once you get the lid cracked open you can lift it the rest of the way with one hand. Other than the screen brightness being a little less, and the glossy screen, this feels like a much more premium laptop, and the 2-in-1+pen functionality is great. Even the included pen is a nice aluminium finish. The build quality (never thought I'd say that about an HP device), speakers and ANSI keyboard (""normal"" layout even though it's bilingual) are where the HP really shine. It definitely is the most premium feeling of the bunch, but the weight and size of it really drag me down. Pun intended. The charger is also a barrel style, and the AC adapter is quite slim. Lastly, the 2 year Costco warranty and generous return policy, for many people, make up the ~$50 in price right there. If there was a 14"" version of this, I'd probably be all over it. The 13.3"" version at bestbuy is too small for my preference, plus the 8GB RAM is not upgradeable on that one. I had a problem with the HP where NordVPN would make the computer think it wasn't connected to the internet. Chrome would function just fine, but any other windows app would tell me I'm not connected to the internet. I haven't installed Nord yet on the two Lenovos, but I'm hoping there won't be any issues. Now, we come to the Flex 5 14 from Amazon. I am coming from a VAIO 13.3"" ultrabook from 2014. Due to the reduced bezel sizes over the years the 14"" of today is the exact same length and width as my 13"" of yesteryear (the flex is a bit thicker, the Sony was positioned as a macbook air competitor at the time and was actually thinner than the Air). So, I'm already thrilled with the form factor and I'm still getting an upsize on my screen. The Flex is the same thickness as the HP, and they have very comparable screens, with the 14"" obviously having a few more PPI. The keyboard feels quite nice, standard Lenovo, obviously missing the num pad being a 14"". The F12 function actually brings up the on-screen calculator, which is neat. It's also a US, ANSI layout, having shipped from the states. The all plastic build is where this suffers a bit, but the graphite grey colour is quite nice and looks more premium than it is. The keyboard deck has a bit of an interesting, grippy texture to it (same as the ideapad). The speakers on the Flex are better than the ideapad, but not quite as good as the HP, lacking a bit more bass. For dialogue I almost couldn't tell the difference, though. If I'm listening to music likely I am playing it on my soundbar or my google home, so speaker quality isn't of much importance to me other than for youtube. I'm not a professional user, I don't own anything with displayport so lacking that from the USB-C port isn't the end of the world to me. It is interesting that the HDMI was tested to output 4K60 since I do sometimes hook up my laptop to my 4K TV. The USB-C charger is nice, I plugged my Oneplus 7T into it once I charged up the laptop a bit (handy!), but the phone didn't recognize it as fast charge or anything. Writing with the pen on this screen, I find it has a weird texture, almost like it's trying to give the feeling of paper? Is that a thing? The HP pen input was totally smooth, like writing on glass (duh). The HP pen is much nicer, the buttons are much more firm and clickly. The buttons on the Lenovo pen are a rocker style, and I found myself accidentally pressing the lower button and turning the pen into an eraser when I was trying to write. Not going to be a deal breaker, I'm sure I could get used to either. The Lenovo pen also has an alumium finish, so a tie there with the HP. The bottom line: in terms of build quality, the HP is the clear winner. Its RAM is also upgradeable from the 8GB it comes with, unlike the Ideapad. The Flex comes with 16GB which I wouldn't be upgrading even if I was able to. The HP also comes with the WiFi 6 card, which I may or may not buy to put into the Flex, maybe in the future if WiFi 6 becomes more prevalent. The bottom line for me is that I just found the HP too big and too damn heavy for carrying around and using on my lap. I'm used to a smaller form factor, and most of the other things being equal, I am going to stick with the Flex 5 14"". For me, I don't use my laptop for work, and 256GB is plenty for me. Most of my stuff is stored in Google drive/photos.  I'd definitely recommend the Flex 5 14 it once the price comes back down! Great commentary, I'm reposting this post here.

A dedicated GPU is much better for gaming than an integrated one. The display seems to be better than the Lenovo as well. It has the same SSD storage at 256 GB and the same 8 GB RAM. The only shame is that it uses an Intel i5 9300H CPU (9th gen CPU which 1 generation old as currently, it is 10th gen) but it will still work fine despite not being as good as AMD 4000 series CPU as you find in the Lenovo, but graphics are generally more important in gaming. It lists the battery life at up to 8 hours but given the Nitro 5 is a gaming laptop, it most likely won't be that high. If you are able to constantly stay plugged into an outlet then that is great. If you really need it more for mobile where your son is in the classroom, you maybe have to bite the bullet and choose the Lenovo over the Nitro 5. With back to school sales and the new AMD 4000 series CPU and Intel 10th Gen CPU gaming laptops slowly rolls out later in the summer, you should be able to find bigger discounts if you are willing to wait.

I currently don't have plans to do a the SSD swap but I'd assume you'll need an external nvme enclosure to clone to the new drive, or, if you're not too fussed, you can install the new drive and just install a fresh copy of Windows 10.

You need to know someone in the UK who doesn't mind sharing the Sky username/password (and would need to use a VPN as well) to get live F1 coverage. Although I did see that they also do commericals like TSN! F1TV Pro has no commericals.

Even if you do this, you could still get the 'employee code' message so go back to Perkopolis, sign out and sign back in again and it should work.

Straight financing for me works out to just under $25/month for 24 months which is a solid deal. I think I'll be taking this deal. Unfortunately, no promos on iPhones now (for our other line)."

1798,"From sammobile.com Vietnam is actually where Samsung phones are made, most of them anyway. Samsung’s manufacturing facility is located in Vietnam’s Thai Nguyen province where two factories are churning out smartphones, tablets and wearable devices. The company is in the process of adding another factory to the facility to further increase its production in the country. The existing factories produce 120 million units per year. Most of Samsung’s global supply, including for markets like North America and Europe, comes from Vietnam. You’d think China would be where most Samsung Galaxy phones are made. China is the global manufacturing hub after all. It’s also where Apple gets the bulk of its iPhones manufactured. Not to mention the fact that Chinese OEMs have come to dominate the smartphone market. Samsung actually shut down its last remaining smartphone factory in China this year. As of 2019, the company is not making any phones in the People’s Republic. It previously had two factories in China but as Samsung’s market share fell below 1% in the country, it had to scale back production. It no longer makes financial sense for Samsung to manufacture phones in China. Which is why it has now stopped doing that. Samsung does operate manufacturing facilities in its home country of South Korea. That’s also where most of the components that it sources from its sister companies are made. However, its smartphone production factory in South Korea accounts for less than 10 percent of global shipments. The units manufactured here are primarily meant for the company’s local market. India not only has Samsung’s biggest mobile factory, but it’s also the largest mobile phone manufacturing unit in the world based on production capacity. Samsung had announced in 2017 that it would invest $620 million to double smartphone production in India. It inaugurated the factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India in 2018. The production capacity of this factory is now at 120 million units per year. Much of the supply is meant for the Indian market. It is one of the most lucrative smartphone markets for Samsung. Given the import taxes in the country, Samsung needs local production in order to effectively compete against its rivals on price. The company has been manufacturing its Galaxy M and Galaxy A series handsets here as well. However, Samsung may also export Indian-manufactured smartphones to markets in Europe, Africa and West Asia."

I grabbed one of these on sale and not only is the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner nearly unusable but you can get nearly as much phone for 1/3-1/2 the price if you grab a mint condition used phone like S9 plus or S10. 120Hz was noticable but made no real difference to me and requires the resolution to be turned down because Samsung somehow has the worst implementation of their own **** OLED panel.

The best time for a trade-in will likely after the Note20 series is released (late August), following past practices Samsung will have a trade-in bonus for the Note20s at that time.

1932,$89 for a google nest hub is quite a good deal. Basically just need to make sure I cancel after the 6 months trial.

1942,Not available in Quebec...of course!

1972,Repost: sirius-xm-get-6-months-siriusxm-google- ... 2349678/5/ Have been discussed here for quite a while.
1973,Noob here new to smart home technology....what's the difference between Google Home and Google Nest Hub?  I have an August lock which works with Google Assistant which I assumed would be used with Google Home to do voice commands. Google Nest seems to do the same thing...what's the difference?

Google home = speaker, Goole Nest Hub = speaker + display. Both has Google Assistant functionality. Difference is that Nest Hub has a screen which makes it a bit more expensive than Google home."
1975,Thanks anyone having issues with ordering the Google Nest? After subscribing to SiriusXM I received a link to purchase my Nest Hub but it's still looking to charge me the full price of the product. Throughout the checkout process it says the promo code has been applied and will be viewable at checkout...I've gone to the final screen but there is no promo code. They also don't provide the actual code in the email so I can't seem to redeem the offer...
1976,"FWIW I strongly recommend people try out the free streaming that SirusXM is offering right now, BEFORE you jump on this deal. The Android app is ATROCIOUS. It crashes all the time, and casting is ALWAYS hit and miss. There is one google speaker it just won't cast to for more than a minute. No other apps have problems with that speaker. Sometimes if you hit pause, it crashes. Sometimes if you skip a song, it stops casting. I was seriously considering going for this deal, but after my experience with the app: hard pass."

Just a warning: TRY the streaming service before buying. SXM currently has free access to their service. I gave it a go, and while the app works fine on my phone, it's HORRIBLE for casting. None of my Google Chromecast devices (of various types) work well. If I get it to start playing (which is rare), it usually stops playing after a few minutes. Have tried different phones, same result. The app crashes all the time, it's just junk. Perhaps the iOS version is better, I don't know, but for Android, I STRONGLY suggest you try it before buying."
2022,I also got in on the Google Nest Hub a few weeks back. Anyone know how to setup their online account? I can listen to the radio fine but I can't edit my subscription information. When I try to set up an account it asks for Radio ID / Account Number / VIN which I do not have (Sirius never sent me any email). I'd like to try the radio and cancel by the 6 month mark to avoid any cancellation fees.

I very rarely find the Crucial P1 to ever be a good deal for what it is, unless you live in Alberta. The Sabrent Rocket Q is $170 and no tax and uses a way better controller.  The SN550 is a nice drive though when it goes on sale but is too expensive right now, with the Sabrent Rocket coming in at $200 with no tax and is a way better drive. For those in Alberta, the SX8200 Pro is only $4 more than the SN550. Both drives are more high end though I do prefer the Sabrent because it's performance is more consistent."

The Sabrent Rocket has moved to an E12s configuration, which is almost as good from a performance standpoint though it does get a bit warmer, it does have the perk of being single sided now in the 1TB configuration (previously it was only single sided up to 512GB). The A80 is now using an SM2262EN, same as the Adata, though I haven't seen benches since the switch."

Are ADATA and Sabrent reliable brands for SSD? I've had a lot of dead ADATA usb sticks and I'm actually not familiar with Sabrent as a brand name Neither Adata nor Sabrent actually manufacture the drives. The drives are assembled by a third party manufacturer and a sticker gets slapped on. The quality will boil down to the product itself, not the company. Both the SX8200 Pro and Sabrent Rocket use quality parts so I wouldn't be worried about abnormally high failure rates, that's not to say they never fail but they're good products."

2123,This may not be popular due to price per weight but this is the best protein powder I've ever had:  
2124,CanadianProtein is $39.99 for 4.4lb ($9.09/lb) MyProtein is $83.99 for 5.5lb ($15.27/lb) but half price makes it $1.45/lb cheaper than CanadianProtein. CanadianProtein will probably have a 20-30% off sale in the next few days but I'm guessing there's better value and taste with the $15/lb protein. Even 30% off $9.09 would only make CanadianProtein $1.30/lb less expensive.  I'll give them a shot. Thanks for posting

2143,"I ordered from these guys for over a year. The chocolate/dark flavours were far superior. The white flavours (butterscotch, donut) were either way too sweet or just tasted weird like a watered down pepto bismol. The sale prices were decent and I was satisfied until I got a bag that had been cut and someone had put a sticker over a hole. I was blown away by this. They said it could have been damaged during shipping which made no sense since it came in a cardboard box. Canada post wouldn't open a box to repair a bag. They did refund my money for the one bag. But not for my whole order. After that incident they lost all credibility to deliver a quality food product in my eyes and I chucked it. These days I find decent stuff at costco. "

You won't get those speeds on a USB connection depends on the enclosure you use right? and the ports available to you thats why I said you can kind of BYOD your own solution that works best for you right now and later 40gbps - you can get a TB3 enclosure for <$100 10gbps - you can get a usb 3.2 gen 2 enclosure for anywhere from $20-$50 5gbps - you can get a usb 3.2 gen 1 enclosure for <$20 and you can always upgrade from USB 3 > TB3 or USB 4 when thats out and I expect the USB 4 enclosure prices to be similar to the existing USB enclosure prices eventually when its out (no TB 3 royalties or bridges required) you don't have to lock yourself in to this SSD, you can buy a great NVMe drive right now for cheap and buy a cheap USB enclosure and upgrade later if thats your budget/requirements"

Copied my Destiny 2 game over and played it for an hour. Places that I know have definite load screens are non-existent using the SSD. As to people saying Emtec isn't a reputable brand, would they be more comfortable with knowing that BASF has been around since 1934 and is still French owned? Not like a lot of brands which are just licensed names owned by Chinese companies (Kodak, Polaroid, etc.). I'm still awaiting the Samsung from Staples. At least I got a ship notice. Several people in the $20 off with coupon code thread are saying their orders got cancelled. At least if I want one of the Emtec drives I can just walk into the store and buy one. On another note, many Seagate portable drives are on clearance from $40 - $60 at Walmart. In case anyone needs one of those... Did some more digging. Emtec was acquired by Dexxon Groupe some years ago. They are another French conglomerate.   "

2238,"Hi everyone, Since the buck-a-beer threads are so popular I thought I'd post a deal from a local brewery. Unfortunately it's in-store only, but it's 30 x 473mL tall boy cans for $60. Only their three main beers are covered by the deal (Craft Lager, Waterloo Dark, and Waterloo IPA). For what it's worth, I think Waterloo Dark is terrific. No mention on their website but they do have a tweet about it. Last time I did this, the price included deposit so the net price is just $1.90 per can.

No update has ever caused any issues (yet), on any of the devices. I gave it a little over 2 years before I jumped on it. I only starting upgrading after ""v1709 aka Fall Creators Update"", which was released in late 2017. I hated the original start menu which was too close to Windows 8 disaster. I hated that. At least they went back to a simpler looking one, and it is a bit of a hybrid of Win7 classic and win8. I've gotten used to it now. For Win10 licensing, when needed, I just hop into out I/T disposal area, and snap a pic of a couple of old Win7 PC COA stickers that we are disposing of, and just use those Win7 keys to activate Win10. Once activated, my PCs are good to go and even after a reinstall, they just auto re-activate and get a ""Windows is activate with a digital license"". There are other ways to get permanent ""digital licenses"", but this one is guaranteed to never get canned. And all these PCs are often stripped and sent to recycling heaven anyhow. Pretty sure most of the ""ebay"" licenses are coming from similar sources. Probably even the I/T guys themselves. All Win7 and Win8.x licenses will work for Win10 activation."

2276,"A lot of problems I noticed is coming from old drivers, if you have no problems with the previous windows, meaning your hardware is fine, a clean install of windows 10 will most likely be stable than the free upgrade ones with old drivers. There is a chance that old hardware will introduce an old driver that isn't up to snuff with Windows 10, but that's the manufacturers fault and they could care less about you using their old hardware. You should rarely see the BSOD as it will relate to either drivers or hardware."

Most BSOD I see are from friends and collègues that decided to to in place upgrades. Old Drivers just never do well during ""upgrades"". I have a lot of old hardware, some even running old Win7 drivers, and all is stable. But all my machines were clean install.  Backup your Data, upgrade to an SSD (best way to add more life into a new PC), and then do a clean install. This way you also keep your old disk, in case you forgot to copy over any old data. You'd be surprised how much quicker many PCs are after an SSD and OS clean install. As long as you have at least 4GB of RAM and at least a Core2 generation CPU and greater, Win10 will work fine. And that hardware specs are not difficult to attain by todays standards. I've done this on many old Dell D620 and D630 laptops (core2Duo CPUs) and makes for a quite usable laptop for schoolwork and even as a basic general purpose machine (no you won't be gaming with it, but all basic tasks work fine)."

OK, initially when you install, it populates the Start menu with all sorts of ""shortcuts"" to various store apps/games (including office). Annoying, YES!!! But simple fix.. After install, just go into the Start menu, right click on the various Group headers, and then click on ""unpin group from start"" option and they all go away. Takes all of 1 minute to do. They are just shortcuts to apps that are NOT truly installed until the first time you click on them. But if you unpin them before you ever click on them, they are gone. Then you can go into start menu and pin only whatever you want to the start menu (or nothing if you prefer)."

2291,"I actually got this deal about 2 weeks ago to upgrade my Windows 10 Home to Pro from a different website run by BetaNews through a Twitter notification that I received. I was skeptical at first, but decided to give it a try and see what happens. Windows 10 upgraded without a hitch to Pro with the supplied key and activated fine. I still have my install media if I need to roll back. It's a good thing that Microsoft decided to include all versions of Windows with their install media and will only activate the components that are associated with that version depending on the key you enter at install, so I can use my existing install media to install Windows 10 Pro even though it is a Windows 10 Home media. Not a bad deal and seems semi-legit at first. I figured that if I get screwed over, I would call my CC to get a chargeback, if a refund fails. No blue screens so far (knock on wood) and Windows 10 has been stable for me all this time even before the upgrade. I have not experienced the catastrophic problems that some users have experienced. I don't have a lot of old hardware and mixing old hardware with old drivers is just asking for trouble. Not a Windows 10 fanboy, but just relaying my experience to help out others in the community. I also built my own PC as well and good luck relying on PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, HP, etc to upgrade their drivers especially when their PC is out of support already and you need updated drivers when an update causes BSOD."

Further, software like Windows 10 is priced differently around the world (to accomidate lower income nations). Add those two together, and you get people selling legitimate Windows 10 keys on ebay for pennies. I'm assuming this website is selling the exact same product, but for ~10x the price."

Every time one of the techs at my company does a warranty repair on one our our enterprise vendor endpoints, the vendor ships the device back wiped clean with an unlicensed W10 Pro OS on it. In the package is a standard Windows restore USB key + a new sealed license for W10 Professional OS (unused). These unused sealed license keys just get tossed into a drawer, as the company has it's own MS Enterprise license agreement which uses it's own KMS/MAK Enterprise OS licensing. Which is applied after the repaired device is reimaged with company image. So buying those cheap ebay keys, could very well be situations like this (if seller is legit)."

You can just download from MSFT the Windows 10 installer to make your Bootable USB, and enter the Windows 7 key to activate it. If your Windows 7 key is HOME Edition, you get windows 10 Home activated. If Windows 7 Pro, then you get Windows 10 Pro. I think the days are gone where you need custom gaming rigs.

I just want a clean OS on my PC. ... I'm no microsoft fanboy, but.... Ads ? Not really ads, unless you OEM added ads to the OEM install (but that is not microsoft's problem - it's the OEM who installs all the bloatware). I have a number of HP laptops, and usually the first thing I do is do a new clean install, because the OEM install has so much bloatware, that it is crazy (hp jumpstart, hp download manager, hp softpaq download manager, hp recovery assistant, hp client security, and the list goes on..). No thanks. But how is that Microsoft's problem ? Are there ads in some of their apps, sure.. But no one forces you to use their weather app, their news app, etc..  On a clean install, you get some app shortcuts added to your start menu, but they can be all removed with a max of 5 clicks.  Bing ? Either switch to a real browser (like Firefox), or take 2 minutes to change the default search engine on Edge or IE. Not very complicated. Cortana ? You can just decline all the requests for permission to be your assistant (during install or first boot), and it is done. Or just go to ""Settings""->""Cortana"" and disable all the options. Done. Microsoft Store ? You are not obliged to use it (unless you are locked in ""S"" mode. But just use the store, unlock the ""S"" mode and then you no longer need it. It is there, but you can simply ignore it, and it will never be in your face. How is that any worse that Apple's app store ?  I use many different OS on a daily basis (Many Linux Flavors, Windows, AIX, and even many other older ones including VMS, SunOS, Solaris, etc..). They all have their pros and cons. And they all take time to customize to everyone's liking. There is no one layout or set of apps which will keep everyone happy.  I'm not saying windows 10 is perfect. There is no perfect OS. And for that matter, there is no one piece of software which is BUG free. But it is finally a semi-decent and for the most part stable platform. Microsoft seems to jump and have every second major OS version being decent and usuable. Started with Windows 98SE2 (good). Then they released Windows Me (sucked so bad, you will surely not find much reference to it on Microsoft web site). Then came XP, which was solid over the years, then came vista (which in my opinion, was an alpha and eventually beta version of Windows 7). Then came Win7 which was also pretty solid. They tried to shove Win8 down everyone's throat, no thanks... Now Windows 10 is not bad again. Apple may be able to control MacOS builds quite well, and updates don't often cause as many issues. Same can be said for other OS, Like AIX. HOWEVER, all these OS, run only a limited hardware base of their choosing. Unlike windows which has so many flavors of hardware configurations, that it is close to impossible to control every single configuration out there. Hell, it still runs on ancient Core2 CPU based machines, and many of those were built back in 2006. With careful install, it can even run with as low as 2.5GB of RAM, even though I recommend minimum 4GB for basic use. If Microsoft came around and said, great, here is our new OS, and you need a maximum of a 5 year old PC to run it, I'm sure many people would be pissed also. Latest version of MacOS Catalina, will not run on anything older than an 8yr old iMac or Macbook. Anything older, you'll will need to be content with an older unsupported OS version. Bottom line, if you want a CLEAN os on your PC, you will NEED to install it yourself from scratch and then disable any services you do not care for. If you expect OEM installs to be clean, then that will not happen. Dell, HP, Acer, ASUS, etc.. all install all sorts of bloatware."

Using cracking software to activate Windows will most definitely install malware on your machine. There are such thing as zero day vulnerabilities. The cracked anti-virus software your using will not catch unknown threats. There is no malware involved in the current methods (assuming you don't try to download it from phishing sites). There are many forums which you can safely download it from. It is not a ""Crack"" in the way you think it is. It is just a PowerShell script which calls a compiled autohotkey script, that uses Microsoft's own loopholes to gather a system signature/state and use that to activate. The only executable is actually also found in Microsoft's own Installation media (gatherosstate.exe), so if you feel better you can even replace the only executable with the one directly off of the installation media. In reality, I used to use this method way back when Win10 came out, only difference, I had not written a script, I would just do everything by hand. If you know where to look, you can even find the sources pretty easily and compile it yourself if you feel more at ease. Once you run it, it leave ZERO trace on your machine, other than the digital activation. Either way, I really don't need to use them any more, since I have so many old Win7 oem licenses from machines that are in Recycling heaven, that I just keep using those for permanent machine at home or for family and friends' machines.. EDIT: But if you are still worried, then you can do one quick install and activate it using the tools... Once activated,,then quickly zap your disk and do another clean install. If it had properly activated before with a digital activation license, then it will auto activate again without the need to run the you call the ""cracks""... The activation is stored in the Microsoft activation servers, and tied to your unique signature. You should never blindly download anything (crack or otherwise) without checking any feedback first. Even keygens in the good old days, I would never run them on my machine, but rather in an isolated secure VM. Win10 makes that easier now even for the basic user, since they added their ""Sandbox"" feature. It is not only ebay's response to ensure content is legit. They have millions of listings and there is only so much they can police. The end-users don't just throw up their hands and ASSUME all is good. An ounce of prevention and common sense goes a long way. And no one is saying the keys are not Genuine, so technically the seller has listed it without error.. They are Genuine keys. they are just not legit and not for resale, or for use by an end user. Just like the keys I use for most of my installs, that I got from decommissioned machines. They are 100% genuine keys (I even have the pics of the COA to prove it). But the keys are OEM keys and tied to the physical machine they were affixed to. That machine gets scrapped, then in theory, the license goes also and it is NOT transferable (unlike a RETAIL license key which is transferable). You are not even allowed to use the OEM license delivered with a PC, if you decide to virtualize it. This is a big issue we have at the office. Some really old machines which we still need to run on XP for customer support issues are slowly failing. I'd live to virtualize them and it can easily be done (technically), but I do NOT have any retail or VLK licenses to support the VM installations. So can I use the OEM licenses on the machines, sure, they will work. But if I get audited (which we do on occasion), they would never pass."

And even just 25 years ago, installing SCO Unix 4.2 off of a 52 disk floppy set.. And then realizing that disk 45 was defective... Ahhhhhhh... Driver compatibility was spotty on any OS of the time. Even minor rev levels, would break compatibility. Often you were stuck in some new development project to ensure your peripheral would work as expected. And even today, with something as robust as Linux, the number of kernel panics if you try to use archaic hardware, is still surprising.  The more hardware you try to support, the more the odds of things ill behaving. And because a peripheral manufacturer has a crappy dev team for drivers (like ATI/AMD for their GPUs), you can't blame Microsoft. I've seen so many BSOD or lagging machines due to el-cheapo bluetooth chipsets (as those found in $3 usb versions sold on ebay), or the el-cheap usb-rs232 adapters which use a knock-off of the prolific chipset, and then people complain when it keeps crashing their machine. Closed and controlled environments  The one major annoyance I have with Windows 10, is the forced Updates. I usually like to do major update every 6 to 8 months. So other than basic stuff like virus signatures, everything else, I'd prefer to choose when to check and install them. That way, I can also prepare (ie: do my backups (in case I let them go a while) and ensure I don't have anything pressing, so in case something happens, I have time to recover. Other than that, I have had a pretty decent experience overall. But like I said, All my installs are clean installs. NO in place upgrades or OEM pre-installations. I find this makes a huge difference."

Gonna shove in 256GB each. Not sure on what to store it on. I have a spare loaded SC846 that I might just 10gbit over instead of using onboard storage or SSDs.

The method I use requires zero things to be installed.  Technically speaking you could count my external KMS server as ""cracking software"" but since it's not compiled (it's a python script) I read it over to see what it contains. It contains nothing but activation procedures.  CameraBill wrote:  I think alot of these Windows 10 complaints are from kiddos who have only experienced the mid windows 7 era.

That's what kids have as a baseline for computing quality. I'm much older than that. I actually liked 98SE despite drivers.  The Microsoft roller coaster dates back to basically the DOS era where every other OS they release was good.  3.11 = good  95 = bad 98 = good ME = bad XP = good Vista = bad 7 = good  8 = bad  And then 10 broke the cycle with being bad.  To be fair... I get why a lot of people are complaining. I'm one of them.  There's so much unkillable crap in Windows now that it's an adventure just to get rid of it.  Me for example even moving to LTSC that doesn't have most of this crap is still crippled by a few things that group policy, registry edits, and 3rd party programs can't kill.  The amount of ""fixing"" for LTSC to be even usable is huge, let alone the amount of fixing you need to do for normal editions of Windows 10.

Generally speaking, no. There are exceptions where people are selling legitimate versions but these typically speaking aren't under $10 which is what most people would describe as ""eBay keys""  The keys work because they are ""working"" keys but they won't pass a software audit. This is really only important if you're using it for business.  The keys (depending on source) can be virgin, used, recycled, or MAK (multiple activation key).  To generalize again, these are typically MSDN keys with the MSDN subscription being from whatever MS is calling their ""acceleration"" program.  These keys are generally aimed at testing/learning purposes and are not valid for production use. The ""acceleration"" program (was Dreamspark, but the name has changed 6 times since then) was the main source since it provided a MSDN subscription for peanuts.  Someone buys this for a few dozen bucks using fake credentials, sells every key they can for a couple of bucks and makes money.  MS sometimes realizes that this guy isn't using it for learning and kills the keys. Sometimes this happens immediately other times it takes years.  Some keys may be stolen from old PCs, bought using stolen credit cards, etc but the majority are MSDN based since it's cheap to acquire and provides keys for literally everything MS has ever published.  The worst part about this is that it's pure straight up piracy but a 3rd party is profiting off of it. This is why I don't really support buying these types of keys.  I tend to favor the KMS route. There's a few ways of doing this too but ""my"" way involves an investment into a linux server (a RasPi would do) which is far more expensive than $3 for a key.  I still argue for it even if it's just one because you can do cool stuff like PiHole too.  Anyways... a long winded response on the origin of these keys.  Side note: I miss TechNet"

I don't know about fines but MS used to have crackdowns in the past on keygens/cracks etc. Every so often. My Windows 7 ultimate was one such case. Stopped working and stopped getting updates. Annoying popup reminders. Ended up buying a legit win 7 Pro version.  Would be easy for them to implement once their tolerance gets low."

Things have changed since Windows 7. A lot of the legal ""tricks"" you can do to get Windows 10 are loopholes that Microsoft could've easily fixed years ago, but they just haven't.

When the laptop supplied to me to do work on in the warehouse, didn't have excel on it. I put a pirated one on it just so I can use it and get my work done. I was desperate.  Didn't think anything of it of getting into trouble. A couple days later IT Manager found out, and I admitted what I had done. He was threatening to go HR with what I did, tampering with company property with illegal software. He just grilled me, saying the implications of the company being sued would be very bad if found out.  He gave me a warning, and not catch me doing anything like that ever again.  So maybe for business use, or if you own a business, this would be a ideal I guess.  But if you're just using it personally, then hell no. It's so easy to hack win 10 pro free easily.

My pc2 was on another time, Windows 10 installs the updates on its own, and boom, bsod. Seriously Microsoft? Your hardware is probably old. It usually has to do with ill optimized hardware rather than the OS. If what you said is correct then how come Windows 10 is not crashing on everyone else's computer. If what you said was true for everyone, it would've been pushed away by many offices like how they did with Windows Vista, Windows 8 etc. Don't get me wrong. I know that Windows 7 is THE MOST stable Windows operating system to date. But Windows 10 is pretty close."

If you can get away with it, there's nothing software wise stopping you.  In fact... if you don't have any money as a business, they probably won't bother you either. Can't get blood from a stone...  But if you're a big successful business, they'll just sue you into oblivion.  Also yes I do recall Dreamspark, a friend told me he got free MS Office from that back in the day. The Azure one is the most complex thus far, I find I have to navigate through a maze of pages to get to the page which has the keys. Did they change it from one page? Back in the day basically everything was on one page.  Then again... I only had TechNet which didn't have Office (I don't think) or Visual Studio.  I did have MSDN for a short while but that account got killed in like 3 months lol. Not bad for $25.  I actually just remembered something.
