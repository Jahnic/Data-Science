    "[RedFlagDeals](https://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/) is a forum where users can post sales or deals that they have come across.

      "[\"Hottest Dell deal I've seen in a while. Thanks to @Neovingian for bringing this to my attention.\\n\\nSign up with an email address and get a 15% off coupon that stacks with other discounts like 10%OFFMONITOR. Also Rakuten has special 6% cash back right now which makes the deals fantastic when combined with Cyber Event discounts, doorcrashers etc.\\n\\nOne thing is it works only with work side stuff, I tried applying the discount to Alienware monitors and it doesn't work (only 10%OFFMONITOR does).\\n\\nI'm guessing these are some of the best prices since lockdown hit. I just ordered a Dell U3415W for $620 - 6%CB = $582. Fantastic price, plus it comes with a 3 year advance exchange warranty and premium panel guarantee. I already own one of these monitors and they are my favourite thing. I couldn't justify the extra cost for the USB-C version, though my wife had to nix me buying the U3818W for ~$950.\\n\\nFor the 15% coupon I did have to wait overnight but it came in less than 24 hours. So, not sure how long Rakuten is doing its cash back but should at least stay at 2%.\\n\\nThis should work for laptops etc too, but since I was shopping here are a couple deals.\\n\\nAnd, to top it all off, if you happen to have access to a Business Platinum Amex, you are going to lose your mind because they have a promotion where you get a $250 statement credit for spending $250 at Dell (that's right, 100% back haha). I'm assuming that works with all this but I don't have one as it is a high cost card. dell.ca/amex\\n\\nPic below of a few of the deals - bear in mind this is before cash back. The 15% off coupon works on multiple items in a single order. The 10%OFFMONITOR works only once per order.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Something to note is that it seems like the coupon code only works for Dell branded products.', \"Isn't Rakuten 2% today?

Thanks to @Neovingian for bringing this to my attention. Sign up with an email address and get a 15% off coupon that stacks with other discounts like 10%OFFMONITOR. Also Rakuten has special 6% cash back right now which makes the deals fantastic when combined with Cyber Event discounts, doorcrashers etc. One thing is it works only with work side stuff, I tried applying the discount to Alienware monitors and it doesn't work (only 10%OFFMONITOR does). I'm guessing these are some of the best prices since lockdown hit. I just ordered a Dell U3415W for $620 - 6%CB = $582. Fantastic price, plus it comes with a 3 year advance exchange warranty and premium panel guarantee. I already own one of these monitors and they are my favourite thing. I couldn't justify the extra cost for the USB-C version, though my wife had to nix me buying the U3818W for ~$950. For the 15% coupon I did have to wait overnight but it came in less than 24 hours. So, not sure how long Rakuten is doing its cash back but should at least stay at 2%. This should work for laptops etc too, but since I was shopping here are a couple deals. And, to top it all off, if you happen to have access to a Business Platinum Amex, you are going to lose your mind because they have a promotion where you get a $250 statement credit for spending $250 at Dell (that's right, 100% back haha). I'm assuming that works with all this but I don't have one as it is a high cost card. dell.ca/amex Pic below of a few of the deals - bear in mind this is before cash back.
